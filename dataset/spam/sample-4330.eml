Hi!<br><br>
I feel sad to apprise you about a couple of disheartening updates for you. =
Approximately a month or 2 ago, I had gain total permission to all your mac=
hines utilized for browsing the online. From here on out, I have started mo=
nitoring your internet activities on a ongoing basis.<br><br>
Go on and take a glance at the series of occurrences provided below for you=
r reference: First, I acquired an private access from hackers to a long cat=
alog of e-mail profiles in this time, that is truly a widespread occurrence=
, which can be organized via online. Evidently, it wasn't difficult for me =
to continue with signing into your email profile.<br><br>
Within the corresponding month, I moved on with setting up a computer virus=
 in OS for every devices that you use to sign in to electronic mail. To be =
honest, it was not a challenging task for me at every as you were kind enou=
gh to select some of the connections in your e-mail inbox before. Yes, brai=
niacs are in our midst.<br><br>
For this Trojan, I am enabled to access the entire array of controllers in =
equipment e.g., your surveillance camera, keyboard, audio input, and others=
. As a consequence, I easily acquired all files, as well as photos, web bro=
wsing history, and other types of information to my servers. Also on, I hav=
e entry to all online platforms accounts that you frequently use, including=
 emails, including conversation records, instant messaging apps, address bo=
ok, etc. My unique malware is continuously modifying its signatures due to =
control by a driver, and hence remains undetected by any type of antivirus =
programs.<br><br>
On that account, I think by now you can already understand the cause why I =
persistently remained undetected until this very communication...<br><br>
During the process of compilation of every the content associated with you,=
 I also noticed that you are a major supporter and regular user of sites fe=
aturing explicit content. Turns out to be, you really adore exploring porn =
sites, as well as watching stimulating recordings and enduring memorable sa=
tisfactions. As a point of fact, I was not able to withstand the allure, ho=
wever to record certain nasty solo action with you in primary role, and lat=
er created several clipsshowing your solo activity and climax scenes.<br><b=
r>
If until now you don't believe me, all I need is a couple of mouse taps to =
make every those recordings with everyone you are acquainted with, includin=
g your peers, colleagues, family and others. Moreover, I am able to post ea=
ch that video on the internet for everyone to view. I sincerely think, you =
certainly would not desire such incidents to happen, in view of the inappro=
priate acts demonstrated in your commonly watched clips, you absolutely kno=
w what I mean by that. It will lead to a huge challenge for you.<br><br>
There is remains a resolution to this issue, and following is what you need=
 to do: You perform a transfer of $1300 USD to my wallet an value in crypto=
, which is recorded according to the conversion rate at the time of money t=
ransfer, accordingly upon obtaining the transaction, I'll instantly dispose=
 of every those incriminating clips without waiting. After that, we can cre=
ate the appearance that there was nothing occurring previously. Additionall=
y, I can verify that each the Trojan software is going to be disabled and d=
eleted from all devices that you operate. You have no to be concerned about=
, because I keep my word at each occasions.<br><br>
That is indeed a advantageous arrangement that comes with a relatively redu=
ced cost, taking into consideration that your profile and traffic were unde=
r strict surveillance during a prolonged duration. If you are yet uncertain=
 regarding how to purchase and execute trades with bitcoins - everything is=
 accessible online.<br><br>
Below is my bitcoin address for your payment ($1300 USD):<br>
1FQ5wTNVzGvqmzfUgFYsEXXGN2cATR7oac
<br><br>
Let's acknowledge it, that is a relatively small sum in today's world.<br><=
br>
All you have is 12 time and the countdown begins once this communication is=
 accessed meaning 2 days.<br><br>
The following catalog includes things you should keep in mind and avoid doi=
ng:<br><br>
- There's no point to try replying to my email as this email and response a=
ddress were generated inside your e-mail account.<br><br>
- There is no purpose in reaching out to law enforcement or any other kinds=
 of security services either. Furthermore, don't you consider distributing =
this data with any of your friends. If I realize that given my abilities, i=
t will be really easy, because I control every your systems and continuousl=
y watch them - your unpleasant video will be released with the public right=
 away.<br><br>
- There is no point in trying to find me too - it will not lead in any succ=
ess. Exchanges with digital currency are completely disguised and invisible=
.<br><br>
- There's no reason in reconfiguring your software on gadgets or endeavorin=
g to get rid of them. That will not solve the issue, since every clips with=
 you as the primary character are previously stored on external servers.<br=
><br>
Matters that may troubling you:<br><br>
- That financial resources transfer will not be received to me. Breathe out=
, I can track down everything right away, so as soon as the funds transfer =
process is done, I'll understand for sure, since I constantly monitor every=
 activities done by you this malware operates each operations remotely, sim=
ply as remote control app.<br><br>
- That your footage will be distributed, even though you have completed the=
 financial resources transaction to my address. Rely on me, it is worthless=
 for me to continue to harass you after the funds transaction is successful=
. In addition, if that was ever part of my agenda, I would make it happen w=
ay sooner!<br><br>
We will tackle and deal with it in a open manner!<br><br>
In closing, I would like to suggest one more suggestion... after this, you =
have to ensure you do not engage in like kind of undesirable events anymore=
! My suggestion - ensure all your passwords are updated with new ones on a =
periodic basis.
