Subject: Action Required: Confirm Your Identity to Prevent Account Suspension

Dear Customer,

In light of several failed login attempts and multiple unauthorized access alerts, our security system has temporarily limited certain functions on your account. To restore full access, you must immediately confirm your identity and update your account details. This verification process is critical to ensure that your account is not compromised.

Please click the secure link below to access our identity confirmation portal:
[http://confirm-your-identity.com]

At the portal, you will be asked to enter your existing credentials, update your password, and answer a series of security questions. Our secure connection employs the latest encryption methods to protect your data during transmission. Furthermore, we advise you to check your recent account activity and report any discrepancies to our fraud department immediately at fraudprevention@secureidentity.com or call 1-800-444-5555.

Failure to complete this process within 24 hours may result in further restrictions or temporary suspension of your account. We take these measures seriously to ensure your personal and financial data remains safe.

Thank you for your prompt attention and cooperation.

Sincerely,
Identity Verification Team
