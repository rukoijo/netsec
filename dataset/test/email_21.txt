Dear Valued Customer,

We have detected unusual activity on your account that requires your immediate attention. Our monitoring systems have observed multiple unauthorized login attempts from an unknown location.

Our records indicate that your account was accessed from an IP address not previously associated with your login history. For your security, we strongly advise that you change your password immediately after the verification process is complete.
